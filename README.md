## Problem Statement

Students and professionals often want to learn new skills but struggle to find peers or mentors who can teach them effectively. Simultaneously, individuals with valuable expertise lack structured, accessible platforms to share their knowledge. This creates educational barriers and limits collaborative growth within communities, particularly for underserved populations who cannot afford traditional tutoring or courses.

## Solution Overview

SkillSwap is a full-stack web application that democratizes education by intelligently connecting learners and teachers based on complementary skill sets. The platform enables users to:

- Register their skills and learning goals
- Discover AI-matched learning partners within their community
- Track collaborative learning sessions
- Receive AI-generated summaries of their progress
- Visualize learning trends and achievements

By leveraging artificial intelligence for semantic skill matching and automatic progress summarization, SkillSwap makes peer learning more efficient, personalized, and accessible to all.

## AI Integration

### AI-Enhanced Skill Matching

SkillSwap employs a hybrid artificial intelligence approach to generate accurate, meaningful learning connections:

**Semantic Similarity Analysis**

- Utilizes TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to identify related skills across different terminology
- Understands contextual relationships (e.g., recognizes that "Data Science" relates to "Machine Learning" and "Statistics")
- Enables flexible matching even when users describe skills differently

**Logical Overlap Matching**

- Ensures practical relevance by comparing skills a user wants to learn against skills another user can teach
- Validates bidirectional compatibility for mutual learning opportunities
- Filters matches based on complementary skill gaps and expertise

**Weighted Scoring System**

- Combines semantic and logical metrics using tunable weights
- Produces ranked recommendations that balance technical similarity with practical teaching capability
- Optimizes match quality through configurable parameters

### AI-Based Session Summarization

When users document their learning sessions, SkillSwap automatically generates concise summaries using the T5-small transformer model from Hugging Face. This feature:

- Extracts core concepts and key takeaways from session notes
- Produces consistent, readable summaries for progress tracking
- Enables better reflection and knowledge retention
- Reduces cognitive load by distilling lengthy notes into actionable insights

**Technical Implementation:**

- Model: `t5-small` (text-to-text transfer transformer)
- Libraries: `transformers`, `torch`, `sentencepiece`
- Processing: Real-time summarization with optimized inference
